# liri-node-app
The functionality of this application allows the user to search for data regarding upcoming concerts, songs and movies

From the Command Line enter 'liri.js'

When prompted, choose between a concert, a song, a movie, or to surprise you with a pre-set song from Spotify

After selecting the functionality the user will be prompted to enter their band, song or movie

The fourth option does not take any arguments as it searches Spotify for the song written in random.txt

The result will be logged to the console as well as appended to the log.txt file which will serve as a history of the user's queries

This is a demonstration of this program's great power to change the world https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I2OqPYc7sA6ZS8M7-AZvcrpBkLm36u_J/view
